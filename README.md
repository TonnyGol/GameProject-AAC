# GameProject-AAC

**2D Java Game** — developed as part of Computer Science studies.

## 🎮 Overview

GameProject-AAC is a 2D game built in Java, using custom code and resources, as part of a university-level Computer Science course.  
The game includes graphics, game logic, and assets, showcasing skills in Java programming, game design, and resource management.

## 🛠️ Features

- 2D graphics and rendering  
- Game logic and mechanics (player control, collisions, scoring, etc.)  
- Asset management: images / sprites / other resources loaded from the `resources/` folder  
- Modular, object-oriented Java code structure (under `src/`)  

## 📁 Repository Structure

/ — Root directory

├── src/ # Java source code

├── resources/ # Game assets (images, sounds, etc.)

├── ONE MAN ARMY.pptx # Project design / concept / presentation

├── README.md # This file

└── .gitignore # Git ignore rules


## ✅ Requirements

- Java 18+  
- (Optional) An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse — to compile and run the project  
- No external dependencies 

## 🚀 How to Build & Run

1. Clone the repository  
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/TonnyGol/GameProject-AAC.git
    ```  
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or compile via command line  
    ```sh
    cd GameProject-AAC/src  
    javac <MainClass>.java  
    java <MainClass>
    ```  
   *Replace `<MainClass>` with the name of the main class (e.g., `Main`, `Game`, etc.).*  
3. Make sure the `resources/` folder is included in the classpath so that assets load correctly.  

## 🧑‍💻 How It’s Organized / Code Structure

- All source code is under `src/` in a package structure (if used).  
- Assets (images, sprites, maybe audio) are stored under `resources/`.  
- The design or concept documentation is included in the `ONE MAN ARMY.pptx` file.  
- The `.gitignore` file excludes IDE-specific files, build artifacts, etc.  

## 🎯 Motivation & What Makes It Useful

This project demonstrates:  
- Practical skills in Java programming (object-oriented design, game loop, resource handling).  
- Ability to integrate assets (graphics, sound) into a real project.  
- A full development cycle from design (presentation) to implementation.
